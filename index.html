<br><br><p class="intro">Hello! My name is Miles Matkovich, and this is my portfolio! I am from Michigan. I am 19, and I am studying CIS Web Development while. attending Henry Ford College. I have loved computers my entire life, and I want to learn more about web and application development. I have been working with HTML and CSS since I was 15, and I've been studying Javascript, PhP, and JQuery since I began college. I also have minimal experience Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but for the time being I'm more concerned with web design. I want to be a freelance web designer, but right now I am just trying to get experience to help me sharpen my skills. I am always interested in work that I can put into my portfolio. I hope to hear from you!
